## Technical Debt & Improvements Needed

### Code Quality
- **Error Handling:** Currently uses basic String errors, needs custom error types
- **Testing:** No test suite present
- **Documentation:** Needs inline documentation improvements
- **Code Organization:** Large stripe.rs file (4,638 lines) should be modularized

### Dependencies
- `reqwest`: 0.11.9 (needs update)
- `tokio`: 1.19.2 (needs update)
- `serde`: Using older patterns

### Architecture Improvements
1. Split stripe.rs into modules by feature
2. Implement trait-based design for payment providers
3. Add retry logic for network failures
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Add request/response logging

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards
- Use idiomatic Rust patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document all public APIs
- Write tests for new features

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each module
- Integration tests with Stripe test API
- Mock tests for offline development
- Performance benchmarks

### Release Process
1. Complete feature implementation
2. Pass all tests
3. Update documentation
4. Version bump in Cargo.toml
5. Create GitHub release
6. Publish to crates.io

## Current Sprint Focus (Active Tasks)
1. ✅ Creating project documentation (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ Analyzing codebase structure (COMPLETED)
3. ✅ Documenting existing Stripe API implementations (COMPLETED)
4. ✅ Creating test suite foundation (COMPLETED)
5. ⏳ Implementing missing Stripe API endpoints
6. ⏳ Improving error handling and async support

## Notes & Observations
- Library focuses on synchronous operations (unique selling point)
- Well-structured for basic Stripe operations
- Needs modernization and expansion for production use
- Good foundation for multi-provider payment processing
- **NO TESTS FOUND** - Critical issue for production readiness
- Large monolithic stripe.rs file (4,638 lines) needs refactoring
- Total of 89 public structs/functions/implementations across codebase
- Dependencies are outdated (tokio 1.19.2 vs current 1.40+)
