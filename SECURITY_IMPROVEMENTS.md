# Security Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security improvements made to protect against accidental credential leaks and improve API key management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Example Files
- **examples/unified_payment_processing.rs**:
  - Removed hardcoded API keys (lines 15, 27-28, 136-143, 148-149)
  - Added environment variable loading with proper error messages
  - Added security warnings in comments

- **examples/stripe_webhook_example.rs**:
  - Removed hardcoded webhook secret (line 7)
  - Added environment variable loading with helpful instructions
  - Added detailed comments on how to obtain webhook secrets

### 2. Created Security Documentation
- **SECURITY.md**: Comprehensive security policy covering:
  - Credential management best practices
  - Secure storage options for different environments
  - Webhook security guidelines
  - Incident response procedures
  - Security checklist for production deployments
  - Regular security tasks and audits

- **.env.example**: Template file with:
  - Placeholder structure for all supported payment providers
  - Clear instructions for each credential type
  - Security best practices reminders
  - Links to provider dashboards for obtaining keys

### 3. Implemented Credential Scanning
- **scripts/scan-secrets.sh**: Automated scanner that:
  - Detects hardcoded API keys and secrets
  - Identifies various credential patterns (Stripe, PayPal, Square, AWS, etc.)
  - Checks for private keys
  - Provides clear remediation instructions

- **hooks/pre-commit**: Git pre-commit hook that:
  - Automatically scans staged files before commit
  - Prevents commits containing potential secrets
  - Provides helpful error messages with remediation steps
  - Can be bypassed with `--no-verify` for legitimate cases

### 4. Enhanced .gitignore
Updated to exclude:
- All .env file variants
- IDE configuration files
- OS-specific files
- Credential and secret files
- Backup files

### 5. Setup Automation
- **scripts/setup-security.sh**: One-command setup that:
  - Installs the pre-commit hook
  - Creates .env from template
  - Sets proper file permissions
  - Verifies .gitignore configuration
  - Runs initial security scan

### 6. Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Added security notice and quick start guide
- **src/lib.rs**: Added security warning in library documentation
- **src/stripe_original.rs**: Fixed hardcoded test key in doc example

## How to Use

### For New Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./scripts/setup-security.sh`
3. Copy your API keys to `.env`
4. Start developing with security protection enabled

### For Existing Projects
1. Run `./scripts/setup-security.sh` to enable security features
2. Run `./scripts/scan-secrets.sh` to scan existing code
3. Update any hardcoded credentials to use environment variables

### Testing Security
```bash
# Scan for secrets manually
./scripts/scan-secrets.sh

# Test pre-commit hook
echo 'let key = "sk_test_EXAMPLE_KEY_123";' > test.rs
git add test.rs
git commit -m "test" # This should fail

# Verify .env is ignored
git status # .env should not appear
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevention**: Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental credential commits
2. **Detection**: Automated scanning identifies potential leaks
3. **Education**: Clear documentation and warnings guide developers
4. **Compliance**: Follows industry best practices for credential management
5. **Auditability**: Security checklist ensures nothing is missed

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Add `scan-secrets.sh` to CI pipeline
2. **Secret Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation schedule
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for unauthorized API usage
4. **Training**: Conduct security awareness training for team
5. **External Scanning**: Consider tools like:
   - TruffleHog
   - GitLeaks
   - GitHub Secret Scanning
   - GitGuardian

## Important Notes

- Never bypass security checks without careful review
- Rotate any keys that may have been exposed
- Use different keys for development/staging/production
- Enable API key restrictions in provider dashboards
- Monitor API usage for anomalies

## Support

For security concerns or questions:
- Review SECURITY.md for detailed guidelines
- Check .env.example for credential setup
- Run setup-security.sh for automatic configuration
- Report security issues privately (never in public issues)
