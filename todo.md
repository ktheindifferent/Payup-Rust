- [x] Extract common HTTP utilities (completed in previous PR)
- [x] Refactor PayPal and Square clients (completed in previous PR)
- [x] Add comprehensive cryptocurrency payment support (completed in previous PR)
- [x] Create unified payment provider interface
- [x] Implement custom error handling system
- [x] Implement comprehensive Stripe Payment Intent API
  - Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, cancel, capture)
  - All payment intent statuses and configuration options
  - Both sync and async method support
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 14 test cases
  - Usage examples in examples/payment_intent_example.rs

## Notes

### Priority Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Blocking issues affecting functionality
- **HIGH**: Important for production readiness
- **MEDIUM**: Enhances usability and maintainability
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Next Sprint Focus (Updated)

#### Phase 1: Critical Security & Reliability (Current Sprint)
1. üî¥ Implement Stripe webhook signature verification (CRITICAL)
2. üî¥ Add idempotency key support across all providers
3. üî¥ Integrate structured logging system
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix 71 failing doc tests
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Clean up 57 compiler warnings

#### Identified Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Security Gaps**:
   - Missing Stripe webhook verification (major vulnerability)
   - No idempotency keys for duplicate charge prevention
   - Missing secure credential management

2. **Production Readiness Gaps**:
   - No structured logging or monitoring
   - Missing pagination for list operations
   - No unified reporting interface
   - Limited error recovery mechanisms

3. **Performance Opportunities**:
   - Connection pooling not optimized
   - No response caching mechanism
   - Missing performance benchmarks

### Technical Debt Tracking
- Total warnings: 57
- Failing doc tests: 71/76
- Lines in stripe.rs: 4,638
- Missing Stripe APIs: 18
- Test coverage gaps: 3 major modules
