## Notes

### Priority Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Blocking issues affecting functionality
- **HIGH**: Important for production readiness
- **MEDIUM**: Enhances usability and maintainability
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Next Sprint Focus (Updated)

#### Phase 2: Reliability & Production Features
1. âœ… Stripe webhook signature verification (COMPLETED)
2. ðŸ”´ Add idempotency key support across all providers
3. ðŸ”´ Integrate structured logging system (tracing)
4. ðŸ”´ Fix failing integration tests (PayPal, unit tests)
5. ðŸ”´ Implement pagination for list operations

#### Identified Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Security Gaps**:
   - Missing Stripe webhook verification (major vulnerability)
   - No idempotency keys for duplicate charge prevention
   - Missing secure credential management

2. **Production Readiness Gaps**:
   - No structured logging or monitoring
   - Missing pagination for list operations
   - No unified reporting interface
   - Limited error recovery mechanisms

3. **Performance Opportunities**:
   - Connection pooling not optimized
   - No response caching mechanism
   - Missing performance benchmarks

### Technical Debt Tracking
- Total warnings: 57
- Failing doc tests: 71/76
- Lines in stripe.rs: 4,638
- Missing Stripe APIs: 18
- Test coverage gaps: 3 major modules
